#PROJECT
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	N-methyl-arginine is taken up into the liver, brain, and kidney of mice.
PR:PROJECT_TYPE                  	Manuscript
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	N-methyl-arginine was identified as a transported substrate through multiple
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	cationic amino acid transporters, which facilitate the uptake of lysine,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	arginine, and other structurally related amino acids. In cell culture,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	N-methyl-arginine inhibits the uptake and metabolism of lysine. In this project,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	we aimed to determine if N-methyl-arginine administered to mice at 80 mg/kg was
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	sufficient to inhibit tissue lysine uptake and metabolism. Following a single
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	injection, N-methyl-arginine significantly accumulated in mouse plasma and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	tissues but failed to significantly inhibit the level of lysine metabolites
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	(e.g., saccharopine). These results are in-line with in vitro results suggesting
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	that N-methyl-arginine is a relatively low affinity transport inhibitor.

#STUDY
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	Metabolomics analysis of kidney, brain, liver, and plasma from Aldh7a1-/- mice
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	administered PBS or N-methyl-arginine (80 mg/kg) via a single intraperitoneal
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	injection.
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Metabolite analysis of kidney, brain, liver, and plasma isolated from Aldh7a1-/-
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	mice fed diets consisting of 0.9% w/w lysine and 18 ppm pyridoxine. Tissues were
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	cryo-homogenized using a liquid nitrogen cooled mortar and pestle into a fine
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	powder and approximately 25-50 mg of each tissue was transferred to a
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	pre-weighed homogenization tube to which ~20 2.3 mm zirconia beads and 1 mL of
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	80% ice cold methanol were added. Tissues were homogenized using a bead mill and
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	cleared by centrifugation at 4C, where each of the 3-4 cycles consisted of a 60
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	second homogenization at 6 m/s followed by a 30 second pause. A volume
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	equivalent to 25 mg of tissue extract was transferred to a new tube, and 250 ul
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	of 80% methanol containing 1 ul of stable isotope-labeled internal amino acid
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	standard mix was added. Metabolites were concentrated using a SpeedVac until
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	dry. For plasma metabolite analysis, 10 µl of plasma was added to 250 µl of
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	80% methanol containing 1 µl of stable isotope-labeled internal amino acid
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	standard mix, vortexed at 4C for 10 minutes, and centrifuged. 0.9 ml of
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	supernatant was transferred to a new tube and concentrated using a SpeedVac
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	until dry. Metabolites were reconstituted into 25-50 µl of water, vortexed,
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	centrifuged, and transferred to vials for analysis by LCMS. LCMS was performed
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	using a ZIC-pHILIC LC column coupled to a Vanquish LC and a flow gradient
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	consisting of 10 mM ammonium carbonate in water and pure acetonitrile. The LC
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	was coupled to an Exploris 240 mass spectrometer operated in a polarity
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	switching data-dependent Top 5 mode. Full MS scan parameters for both positive
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	and negative mode were set to 67-1000 m/z at a resolution of 120k and ddMS2 were
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	collected at a resolution of 30k.
